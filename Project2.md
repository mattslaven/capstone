# Refugee resettlement vs. economic growth
<ol><li><b>High level description:</b> Determine any correlation between refugee resettlement and economic growth.<br>
  <li><b>Problem I am attempting to address:</b> Over the past few years, a variety of countries have expressed growing support for decreasing immigration. With intranational military conflict occuring across several continents, this has made it more difficult for some displaced populations to seek sanctuary.<br>
<li><b>Presentation of work:</b> I plan to create a report and summary presentation showing the results of machine learning models applied to available data.<br>
<li><b>Data sources:</b>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)</a>
<li><a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ds/matrix.html">International Monetary Fund</a></ul>
<li><b>Next steps:</b> Getting access to the data, and determining which fields may be available to join the data.</ol>
