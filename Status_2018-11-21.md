<b>AMAZON WEB SERVICES (AWS)</b><br>
Yesterday led to continued frustration attempting to setup AWS for the federal spending data.<br><br>
<b>Issues:<b><br>
<ul><li>After spending another half day attempting to access a command line from the Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Postgres instance that I had created, I found nothing leading to the conclusion that this is possible.
<li>As a fallback, I next decided to create an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) on which I would use PostgreSQL. It seemed logical to search for an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that already had PostgreSQL included. I selected a Bitnami instance.
<li>After creating this instance, I used <code>curl -O https://files.usaspending.gov/database_download/usaspending-db_20181113.zip</code> to download the 45 Gb zipped file. This process lasted 35 minutes at an average transfer speed of 21.8 Mbps.
<li>When I tried to login into psql, I was asked for a password. Unfortunately, I was unable to determine what this was.

<li>After consulting Dan in the morning, he suggested looking for readme files that would have been installed in the EC2 root directory. Unfortunately, I was no longer able to log into the EC2 instance this morning.

<b>SPENDING DATA</b><br>
Issues:<br>
1. According to database installation <a href="https://files.usaspending.gov/database_download/usaspending-db-setup.pdf">instructions</a>, 50 Gb needed locally for installation. After clearing space on my local hard drive, I now have nearly 200 Gb (of 500 Gb) free. When I tried to unzip the 46 Gb file that I downloaded, I received the following error message.<br>

2. The instructions also state that 1 TB is needed "to store the fully restored database." This seems to imply that I will need to run the spending data from an Amazon cluster.<br>
3. I have reviewed the data dictionary for the spending data, but do not yet understand this well enough to have determined how I will segment this data.<br><br>
<b>VOTING DATA</b><br>
I have manually cleaned the voting data for 2016 and 2014. I am about 2/3 complete with the manual cleaning of the 2012 vote counts. Electoral features that I intend to analyze include:<br>
1. How many candidates ran for each congressional seat?<br>
2. What was the % margin of victory?<br>
3. What is the average number of votes cast for each seat? (I plan to use this as a proxy for the number of constituents represented.)
