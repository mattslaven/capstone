# Diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease
<ol><li><b>High level description:</b> According to the Alzheimer's Association, nearly 6 million Americans currently have Alzheimer’s dementia (<a href="https://www.alz.org/media/HomeOffice/Facts%20and%20Figures/facts-and-figures.pdf">report</a>). A number of organizations have consolidated medical data and made (limited) access to this data available to the scientific community in the hopes for new insight.<br>
<li><b>Problem I am attempting to address:</b> Any improvement in our ability to diagnosis this diease earlier would help families take necessary actions to prepare.<br>
<li><b>Presentation of work:</b> I plan to create a report and summary presentation showing any indicators that may lead to improved diagnoses.<br>
<li><b>Data sources:</b>
<ul><li><a href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/">Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)</a>
<li><a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/amp-ad">Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) Knowledge Portal</a></ul>
<li><b>Next steps:</b> Getting access to the data. These sources require permission to access, so I need to complete my request to initiate the process.</ol>
